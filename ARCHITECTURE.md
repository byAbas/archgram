# Architecture

How archgram is built and why it is built that way. Which document holds
every other fact is in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Each fact lives in one
document).

## Bird's eye view

archgram is a pure function from a spec to a picture:

```
spec (JSON, or YAML through archgram-yaml)
  -> parse and validate      typed Spec, errors with their location
  -> model                   graph IR: nodes, frames, edges, flows, in spec order
  -> measure                 each label measured with the embedded font; box sizes
  -> layout                  layers, order, coordinates, frames
  -> route                   orthogonal edge paths around the boxes
  -> render                  SVG: shapes, theme, legend, optional animation
  -> rasterise (later)       PNG per theme, through archgram-png
```

Every stage takes the previous stage's output and returns a new value. No
stage reads files, the clock or the environment, so the same code runs
natively, in Node and in the browser, and the same input always gives the
same bytes.

## Code map

The repository is one Cargo workspace.

| Crate | Holds | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `archgram-core` | Spec types, validation, the check of each source against the code, IR, measuring, layout, routing, SVG, themes and their import from DTCG tokens, the flows' timing and animation, the embedded font and its subsetter | `serde`, `serde_json`, `skrifa` |
| `archgram-icons` | Technology logos: a pinned release of Simple Icons as data, written by `cargo xtask icons <tag> <commit>`, through the core's `Logos` trait | `archgram-core` |
| `archgram-yaml` | YAML to the core's `Spec`, with line and column in errors | `archgram-core`, `saphyr-parser` |
| `archgram-png` (later) | The scene to PNG, one theme at a time, with archgram's own rasterizer | `archgram-core` |
| `archgram-cli` | The `archgram` binary: files, flags, exit codes | the crates above |
| `archgram-wasm` (later) | The WASM package, for the browser | `archgram-core`, `archgram-yaml`, `wasm-bindgen` |
| `xtask` | Repository tasks run with `cargo xtask`: the logos, the embedded fonts, the npm packages; never shipped | `archgram-core`, `serde_json` |

`archgram-core` does no I/O. Anything that touches the file system or the
terminal lives in `archgram-cli`. The core carries no logos either: it
draws those it is given through `Logos`, so the WASM package stays small
and can hand over only the logos a diagram names, while the CLI passes
all of `archgram-icons`.

### Design tokens in the build

`archgram-core`'s build script reads `design-system/tokens/` at compile
time: it follows the resolver, resolves every alias, and writes one table
of values per palette and theme into the crate: a `Role` for every colour
token, and each palette's colours as values (`Rgb`), not text. The tokens
stay the only place a value is written; changing one rebuilds the crate,
and no colour or size is typed by hand in the code.

### A project's tokens as the theme

`theme::import` reads a mapping file (docs/SPEC.md, Theme file) and the
project's DTCG resolver at run time, into the same `Colors` the build
writes, one per theme; the render options carry them in place of the
spec's palette. The core reads no file: the caller hands it each file's
text by its path, the CLI from disk, the WASM package from JavaScript.
Only the parts of the Resolver Module that reading colours needs are
there, with anything else refused by name. Colours are converted from
their colour space with archgram's own elementary functions (`math`):
the platform's `powf`, `sin` and the like may differ in their last digit
between machines, and clippy refuses them in the core. The imported
colours pass the same contrast check as archgram's own (`color::check`,
the pairs DESIGN.md names), or the import fails.

## The pipeline, stage by stage

### Parse and validate

`serde_json` reads the spec into Rust types with `deny_unknown_fields`, so
a misspelt field is an error, not a silent default. Validation then checks
what types cannot express: every edge names existing nodes, frame nesting
has no cycles, flows follow existing edges. Errors carry a JSON pointer in
the core and a line and column through `archgram-yaml`.

A node's or an edge's `source` (docs/SPEC.md, Sources) is checked here
for its form only. Whether the code is there is `sources::check`, which
reads no file either: the caller looks each file up once, by its path in
one spelling, with every word any source wants from it, and hands back
what is there (a file, with whether it holds each word; a folder;
nothing; or why it is not read). The CLI's `files` module is the one
place the command reads a file, a spec, a theme or a source, under the
rules in SECURITY.md (What archgram reads): it finds the project's
folder, lists each folder once, reads a file only for its words and
keeps no text. The check runs in `check`, as problems, and in `build`,
as warnings. The drawing never sees a source, so the SVG is the same
with or without them.

`archgram-yaml` reads `saphyr-parser`'s events (YAML 1.2) into its own
tree, each value with its line and column, writes the tree as JSON, one
value per line, and lets the core read and check it. Each problem the
core finds comes back to the YAML: a JSON line maps to its key's position,
a JSON pointer to its value's. So every rule lives once, in the core, and
a YAML author still sees `line:column`. The tree is the crate's own, not
saphyr's loader, because the loader keeps the last of two equal keys and
expands aliases without limit; the YAML a spec may not use, these among
it, is in docs/SPEC.md (Formats), and the crate's `MAX_DEPTH` and
`MAX_EXPANDED` hold its limits. Plain scalars follow the core schema
(null, booleans, integers, floats; the rest is text); a plain number
where text belongs is reported with the advice to quote it.

### Model

The IR stores nodes, edges and frames in vectors and refers to them by
index. Iteration always follows spec order. Hash maps are never iterated;
where a lookup is needed, the key is an index or the map is ordered. This
is the first half of determinism.

### Measure

Labels are measured with the advance widths of Geist, read with
`skrifa`. The static Regular and Medium TTF files ship inside the binary
under their OFL licence, so measurements do not depend on the fonts
installed on a machine. A box's size comes from its kind's template (icon
area, padding) and its measured label. A node with several instances
takes the footprint of its whole stack, the front card plus
`card.multi-offset` twice in each direction, so the layout keeps the
stack clear of its neighbours; its anchor across the layers is the front
card's middle, so a straight edge meets the card a reader sees first.
Along the flow the front card takes its column's width like any other
card, and the stack reaches past it into the gap (to the right when the
flow runs right, up when it runs down).

One list of text runs, each with its weight (node titles and notes, edge
labels), feeds both the embedded font's subset and the warning for
characters Geist lacks, so neither can miss a text the other covers.

### Layout

A layered layout in the Sugiyama tradition. First the spec is split into
units that share nothing: no edge, no hint group, no top-level frame
(component packing, as Graphviz `pack` and ELK's
`separateConnectedComponents` do). Each unit with edges runs the steps
below on its own. A unit without edges is set out as a grid, and lone
nodes without edges share one grid. The unit with the most nodes comes
first; the others follow in the order of their first node, in rows below
it no wider than the widest unit, `spacing.pack` apart. When no unit has
edges at all, every node goes in one grid with about as many columns as
rows. Hints are checked on the whole spec, so an error points at the
spec's own hint; cycle removal treats each connected part on its own, so
the units would find the same errors. The steps:

1. Cycle removal. Edges that point back against the flow are reversed for
   the duration of the layout, chosen with a greedy feedback-arc-set
   heuristic; ties break by spec order.
2. Layering. Each node gets a layer (a column when the flow runs right)
   by network simplex, which keeps edges short. Layout hints fix a
   node's layer. Edges spanning several layers are split by dummy nodes.
3. Crossing reduction. Layers are swept back and forth, ordering nodes by
   the barycentre of their neighbours, then adjacent pairs are swapped
   while that removes crossings. Spec order is the starting order and the
   tie-break; the number of sweeps is fixed.
4. Coordinates. Brandes–Köpf alignment gives straight edges where
   possible and balanced positions elsewhere: four alignments (towards the
   layer above or below, from either end), aligned to the narrowest, each
   vertex at the mean of its two middle values. Blocks are placed by a
   longest-path pass over the graph of blocks rather than the paper's class
   shifts, which its 2020 erratum shows can misplace classes.
5. Frames, in the one global layout, as dagre lays out compound graphs
   (Sander 1996; Forster 2002), not frame by frame: laying each frame out
   alone and then treating it as one big node (ELK's separate children)
   makes rigid blocks with long gaps, and edges between frames need ports
   on their borders. Here nodes keep their global layers and:
   - a frame spans the layers from its first descendant node to its last;
     each dummy of a long edge sits in the innermost frame it passes
     through (dagre's `parentDummyChains`);
   - on every layer it spans, a frame has a first and a last border
     vertex, chained across the layers;
   - crossing reduction sorts a layer frame by frame, a child frame as one
     item at the mean key of what it holds, between its borders; frames
     side by side keep the order they had in the layer just placed; a swap
     only trades two vertices of one frame. An `order` hint must stay
     within one frame, so it never breaks one apart;
   - coordinates align each border chain first, as one block, and no other
     alignment may cross it, so a frame is a rectangle holding its own and
     nothing else. Its padding (with room for its name on top, across the
     layers when the flow runs right) separates its borders from what it
     holds. Should the blocks ever form a cycle, every non-border vertex
     stands alone and the layout carries on; debug builds stop there, and
     the tests would;
   - along the flow, the gaps keep each frame's padding where it starts and
     ends, nested frames adding theirs inside, and tracks stay outside
     them. Flowing down, the name's room is part of that padding; a frame
     is never shorter or narrower than its name.
   Layering ignores frames, so a frame whose nodes lie far apart spans the
   layers between them; dagre's nesting edges would pull them together
   and remain an option.
6. Direction. The layout is computed left to right; top to bottom is a
   transform of the result. `direction: auto` is decided before layout,
   in `draw_with` and `draw_themes`: the spec is laid out and its scene
   built left to right, and when the scene is wider than 1,300 px
   (`README_WIDTH`), top to bottom too, keeping the narrower. Layout
   itself only ever sees right or down, and the drawing reports its size
   and the direction chosen, which `archgram build` prints.

### Route

Edges are routed after the layout has placed the cards and the bends of
long edges, using the layered structure itself (as ELK's layered router
does) rather than a general search:

- Every edge is a chain of hops between adjacent layers. A hop runs through
  the gap between two layers, where no card stands, so an edge cannot pass
  through a card by construction.
- A hop whose two ends are level is one straight segment; otherwise it is a
  symmetric Z: out of its start, onto a vertical segment (a track) in the
  gap, and into its end. A long edge runs straight through the layers it
  crosses, at the place the layout kept for it, `spacing.edge-edge` clear of
  the cards beside it.
- Each card's edges on one side get ports. The plain ones share one port
  as a bundle, and a bundle turns at one track: edges leaving a side leave
  as a trunk that forks in the gap, edges entering a side merge into one
  point along one trunk (the look of hand-drawn flow diagrams). A hop in
  both kinds of bundle follows the one leaving. An edge whose label sits
  just past the card, and an edge reversed against the flow, get ports of
  their own; all ports are spread `spacing.edge-edge` apart around the
  side's middle, ordered by where their other ends lie (a bundle by its
  middle) so they do not cross as they leave. A port whose
  edge carries its label just past the card keeps its neighbours that
  label's reach plus half of `spacing.edge-edge` away. When a side is too
  short for all its ports, every gap shrinks in proportion, unless one of
  them carries a label: then the card grows across the flow by what the
  side lacks and the layout runs again, a few times at most, so a label
  never lies on a neighbouring line or another label.
- Vertical segments that overlap in a gap get separate tracks. For each
  overlapping pair, the order that crosses fewer of the other hop's
  horizontal segments wins, unless one leaves along the line the other
  arrives on: that one turns first, or it would run along the other; a
  cycle of these is broken at a riser none of them holds back. Each
  segment then takes the lowest track clear of those it overlaps.
- Two hops between four different ends never share a stretch of line.
  When one hop leaves along a line that another has already joined
  (two cards each leading to the same two make such a cycle), the hop
  leaves its trunk for a port of its own, or else the other leaves its
  merge; a card's lone port as a last resort steps off the line. The
  bundle left behind keeps the side's middle, so a straight hop in it
  stays straight, and the split port stands twice `rounded.connector`
  from it where the side has room, so the crossing falls on straight
  stretches. Ports and tracks are then found again, until no two lines
  share a stretch. A side carrying a label keeps its ports, and with them
  the room the layout left for the label. Tracks keep clear of the cards on both sides: a
  bend's radius (or a label's room) after the card an edge leaves, and
  before the card it points at a bend's radius, twice the arrowhead's
  length and its gap, so the last bend is whole and the arrowhead sits on
  a straight run. A gap needing more room than it has widens.
- An edge label gets room of its own, as in dagre and ELK. On an edge
  longer than one layer it stands in for the middle dummy vertex, sized to
  the label, so crossing reduction and coordinates keep it clear of cards.
  On an edge between neighbouring layers, the gap it leaves into reserves
  the label's length plus `spacing.edge-edge` on each side before its
  tracks, and the label sits on the segment leaving the first card, in
  that room, straight edge or not; past the border of each frame the edge
  leaves there, in the room the gap keeps for it, so a label never lies
  on a frame's border. The label is drawn on a patch of canvas colour.

A general orthogonal router (visibility graph and A*, as in libavoid) is
not needed while every edge follows the layers; it stays an option should
frames or free placement ever call for it.

### Render

Rendering first builds a scene (`render::scene`): every shape in drawing
order, typed (canvas, rectangle, circle, path, text, icon, group), each
naming its style by class, with the style sheet beside it. The classes a
still drawing uses and their declarations are one table (`render::styles`):
the SVG writes it as CSS, and a rasterizer reads the same rules, so a PNG
cannot drift from the SVG. What moves is SVG markup kept as it is written,
invisible in the still image. The icons are lists of shapes, not markup:
Hugeicons' drawings, copied once into `render::icons`.

The SVG writer (`render::svg`) turns the scene into a string with fixed
number formatting (two decimals) and a fixed attribute order, the second
half of determinism. Each node kind has a shape function; the theme becomes CSS custom properties, with
the dark values under `prefers-color-scheme`, or one file per theme on
request. The legend (DESIGN.md, Components: Legend) is generated from
the spec and laid out below the diagram (`layout::legend`), in rows no
wider than the diagram; its text is part of the text runs, so the font subset
carries it. A technology logo is its Simple Icons path scaled from the
24 by 24 grid into one of four places: the card's corner, the start of
its second line, a round chip on the badge, or the badge in place of the
icon. A card whose logo goes in the corner keeps its width of room beside
the title; an inline logo widens the second line, which without a note
shows the technology's name from the logo set. The set also carries each
brand's colour, which a class per technology gives its logos in each
theme; which colour a logo takes is in DESIGN.md (Components: Technology
logo). `tech` is checked against the logos given, with
the nearest slugs suggested; with none given it is neither checked nor
drawn.

The text is drawn in the same font it was measured with. archgram's own
subsetter cuts Geist down to the glyphs the diagram uses (keeping the
tables a renderer needs: `head`, `hhea`, `maxp`, `hmtx`, `cmap`, `loca`,
`glyf`, `post`, `name`, `OS/2`, with composite glyphs followed to their
parts) and embeds the result as a data URI in an `@font-face` rule, so
the text looks the same on every machine. The subsetter handles static
TrueType outlines only; variable fonts are out of scope. `--system-font`
skips the embedding and falls back to the system font stack.

### Animate

Flows turn into a timeline (`motion`), in whole milliseconds. Each hop
lasts in proportion to its edge's length as drawn, within a minimum and
a maximum: the render stage splits every edge into its pieces (lines,
quarter circles, the S curves of short jogs) and measures them with
`+ * / sqrt` only, a curve by Gauss–Legendre quadrature, so the timing
is the same on every machine. A step may branch: its signals leave
together, and signals meeting at a node arrive together, when the slowest
does. A card is lit from its signal's arrival until every signal it
sends has arrived; each lit time says whether the card passes or
refuses, where its border starts (the arrowhead that reached it, the line
its signal leaves by, or the line a refusal comes back along) and how
long it takes to close. A flow that stops is refused at its last step: the
refusal travels back along every line the flow took, the refusing card
stays refused until a later flow passes it, and the next flow starts a
rest after the refusal is back. Lit times of one card and one state closer
than two fades are joined, so one fade ends before the next begins.

The output is SMIL, which runs where CSS and scripts do not (an `<img>`,
GitHub): one cycle shared by every animation; each signal follows its
edge's own path by `mpath`; a lit card's border (`render::border`) is
its own outline, walked as straight sides and quarter circles from the
point the arrow meets it, drawn in by a dash offset along two halves; a
refusal (`render::refusal`) is a ✕ on the line, its arrowhead and its way
back, the same line drawn backwards. An arrowhead a signal reaches is a
chevron of its own over the edge's marker, in the signal's colour.
Everything starts invisible, so a reader that runs no animation shows
the still diagram. `KeyTrack` is the only writer of `keyTimes`, and holds
SMIL's rules on them (Invariants). A brand colour too faint on a theme's
card falls back to the text colour; the contrast is computed from a
fixed table of the sRGB curve (`color`), not the platform's `powf`.
Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the signals, borders and refusals are
hidden, and each refusal's ✕ and the refusing card's border are shown
still. What the still image shows of the flows is the spec's: the
flows in words, laid out under the legend (`layout::legend`), or each
step's number on its lines, placed by the render stage clear of cards
and labels, and drawn above the signals. A signal lights each number it
passes, its pill traced like a lit card's border from the moment the
eased signal reaches it (`motion::reached`); the light is one of the
borders, so it is hidden with them.

### Rasterise

Later (PRD, §5). `archgram-png` will draw the scene (Render) into pixels
with archgram's own rasterizer, one theme at a time, reading the same
style table as the SVG; what moves is not drawn, so the PNG is the still
image. No third-party renderer: `resvg` and `tiny-skia` were weighed and
left out to keep the supply chain small.

## Invariants

These hold for every output and are checked by tests on every change.

- The same spec gives byte-identical output on every platform.
- No two boxes overlap; no edge passes through a box it does not touch.
- Every edge is orthogonal.
- Two edges between four different cards never share a stretch of line.
- No two edge labels overlap, no label lies across a frame's border, and
  no line leaving a card's side runs under a label leaving the same side.
- A frame holds its nodes and child frames with its padding around them;
  nothing else reaches into it, and frames that do not nest stay apart.
- Every text pair meets WCAG 2.1 AA in both themes, imported ones too.
- Every `keyTimes` starts at 0, ends at 1 and never goes back, with one
  value per time and one spline per interval.
- `archgram-core` calls no elementary function of the platform's maths
  library (`clippy.toml`): its own (`math`) use only operations IEEE 754
  rounds exactly.
- `archgram-core` performs no I/O.
- archgram's own crates contain no `unsafe` code
  (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`).

## Dependencies and supply chain

| Crate | Why | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `serde`, `serde_json` | Reading the spec | MIT or Apache-2.0 |
| `skrifa` | Font metrics; the font parser Chrome uses | MIT or Apache-2.0 |
| `saphyr-parser` | YAML events with positions, in the optional module; with it `arraydeque` and `thiserror` | MIT or Apache-2.0 |
| `wasm-bindgen` | The WASM package, later | MIT or Apache-2.0 |

- `Cargo.lock` is committed and versions are pinned; builds run with
  `--locked`, so no dependency updates itself.
- Each crate enables only the features it needs.
- How a dependency is added or updated is in CONTRIBUTING.md (No new
  dependency without an issue first).
- CI checks the whole tree with cargo-deny against `deny.toml`, the one
  list of what a dependency may be: every package's licence, its source
  (crates.io only) and every version in `Cargo.lock` against the RustSec
  advisory database. A licence or a source outside the list fails any
  change. An advisory fails a change that touches `Cargo.toml`,
  `Cargo.lock` or `deny.toml`, and only warns on any other, since one can
  be published at any time; main is checked against the database every
  week (`.github/workflows/advisories.yml`).
- Cargo's own `cargo tree` shows where each indirect dependency comes from.
- Logo data is pinned like a dependency: `archgram-icons/data/RELEASE`
  names the Simple Icons tag and commit, `cargo xtask icons <tag> <commit>`
  rewrites the data from that tag alone and refuses it unless the tag is
  still at that commit, and an update is a reviewed
  change. The data is CC0-1.0, on the allowed list for that crate; a logo
  carrying a licence of its own other than CC0 is left out, and
  `provenance.tsv` keeps each logo's source and brand guidelines.
- The node kinds' icons are copied, not pinned: 17 drawings from
  Hugeicons (MIT), taken once from the commit `render/icons.rs` names,
  with their numbers rounded to two decimals. Nothing fetches them again;
  an update is a reviewed change by hand, and THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES keeps
  their licence.

## Testing

There are no test dependencies. Golden-file comparison and a seeded random
spec generator are small helpers inside the workspace.

- Unit tests per stage, each on small hand-made graphs.
- Property tests of the invariants above on specs from the seeded
  generator.
- Snapshot tests of the SVG for a fixed set of example specs, including
  the two diagrams of ai-powered-cv-screener.
- A determinism job that renders every example on macOS, Linux and
  Windows and compares the bytes.
- Benchmarks of layout and rendering against the budgets below.

## Performance budget

| Measure | Budget |
|---|---|
| Layout and SVG, 100 nodes, native | under 50 ms |
| CLI start to written file, small spec | under 100 ms |
| `archgram-core` WASM, optimised (later) | under 350 KB gzipped |
| PNG, 1600 x 1000, native (later) | under 100 ms |

## Distribution

- On npm, the binaries as Turborepo and Biome ship theirs: one package per
  platform, `@archgram/cli-<os>-<cpu>` for macOS, Linux and Windows on x64
  and arm64, each declaring its `os` and `cpu` so npm installs only the
  one that fits; and `archgram`, whose `bin` is a launcher that finds that
  package and runs its binary, and which lists them all as
  `optionalDependencies`. No install script runs and nothing is downloaded
  at install time, so it works where pnpm, Bun or policy block scripts.
  The Linux binaries are linked statically against musl, so one file runs
  on every distribution, Alpine included. The launcher has no
  dependencies; `ARCHGRAM_BINARY` points it at another binary.
  `cargo xtask npm` assembles the packages from the built binaries.
  Publishing uses npm's trusted publishing (OIDC), which attaches
  provenance and needs no stored token, and it only stages: each package
  goes public when a maintainer approves it with two-factor
  authentication (RELEASE.md).
- The GitHub release carries the agent skill (`skills/archgram`) as
  an archive, with a signed build provenance attestation (`actions/attest`,
  SLSA Build Level 2) and a `SHA256SUMS`. The command itself ships only on
  npm. The workflow drafts the release and a maintainer publishes it;
  releases are immutable once published.
- The skill is one folder, installed as docs/PRD.md (6.5) says. It runs
  archgram through npx, the project's own or the version released with the
  skill (docs/PRD.md 6.6), and reads the spec format from `archgram spec`,
  the text of docs/SPEC.md carried in the binary, so it keeps no copy of
  the format. Its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, icon and README make the
  same folder a Claude Code plugin of one skill, so Anthropic's plugin
  directory takes that folder and not the repository.
- Later: a WASM package for the browser, and the PNG module as a
  separate, optional package.
- Crates on crates.io once the API is stable.
- One SVG carries both themes by default. `archgram build --split-themes`
  lays the diagram out once and writes `<name>.light.svg` and
  `<name>.dark.svg`, one theme each, for pages that choose per reader:

  ```html
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="diagram.dark.svg">
    <img alt="…" src="diagram.light.svg">
  </picture>
  ```
