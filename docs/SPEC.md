# The archgram spec

The input format: what a diagram is made of and the rules a spec must
follow. Why the format looks like this, and every other fact about
archgram, is in its repository's other documents; `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Each
fact lives in one document) says which holds what.

A spec describes the system, never the drawing. It has no coordinates, no
sizes and no colours. It names things, groups them and connects them;
archgram decides where they go and how they look.

## In brief

One spec that uses each field most diagrams need, and a line for each
other section. `archgram spec --brief` prints this section alone, and
`archgram spec --section <name>` prints another, by the name below.

```yaml
archgram: 1
title: shop
description: >-
  A customer places an order with the API, which queues it; a worker
  saves it to Postgres and mails a receipt through Resend.
direction: auto
nodes:
  - { id: browser, kind: browser, label: Customer }
  - { id: api, kind: service, label: API, tech: express, frame: app, source: ../../src/api.ts }
  - { id: queue, kind: queue, label: orders, tech: redis, source: ../../src/queue.ts }
  - { id: worker, kind: service, label: Worker, frame: app, source: ../../src/worker.ts }
  - { id: db, kind: database, label: Postgres, tech: postgresql, source: ../../src/db.ts }
  - { id: mail, kind: service, label: Resend, variant: external, source: ../../src/mail.ts }
frames:
  - { id: app, label: Our services }
edges:
  - { from: browser, to: api, label: POST /orders, source: '../../src/api.ts#app.post("/orders"' }
  - { from: api, to: queue, source: "../../src/api.ts#orders.add(" }
  - { from: queue, to: worker, source: "../../src/worker.ts#new Worker(" }
  - { from: worker, to: db, label: insert order, source: "../../src/worker.ts#saveOrder(" }
  - { from: worker, to: mail, label: receipt, style: dashed, source: "../../src/worker.ts#sendReceipt(" }
flows:
  - { name: an order, steps: [browser, api, queue, worker, [db, mail]] }
```

A writer that reads the code gives a `source` to every node a file backs
and to every edge, as above, and quotes each source that holds a `#`.

- `formats`: JSON or YAML, and the file name that draws `<name>.svg`.
- `top-level`: every field above the lists, with its values and
  default, `direction` and how a flow is drawn among them.
- `nodes`: a node's fields, and every kind by category.
- `frames`: a frame's fields, and nesting one in another.
- `edges`: an edge's fields, and what an edge means.
- `flows`: steps, branches, a flow that stops, and how archgram times them.
- `hints`: `first`, `last`, `sameLayer` and `order`.
- `sources`: what a source may name, and how archgram looks it up.
- `validation`: what makes a spec invalid.
- `theme-file`: drawing in a project's own colours.
- `examples`: complete specs, in JSON and YAML.

## Formats

The core reads JSON. The optional YAML module reads YAML 1.2 and produces
the same spec, so every example below can be written either way; the
command line tells them apart by the file's extension (`.json`, `.yaml`,
`.yml`). Unknown fields are errors, not ignored, so a misspelt field is
caught instead of silently changing the diagram. In YAML, a key written
twice, a second document, a tag outside YAML's core schema, nesting deeper
than 64 levels and aliases that expand to more than 10 000 values are
errors too, and a plain word that reads as a number or a boolean (`title: 2026`)
must be quoted to stay text.

A spec named `<name>.archgram.yaml` (or `.archgram.yml`, `.archgram.json`) draws
`<name>.svg` beside it, so each spec sits next to its drawing and the
drawing keeps a plain name; any other spec draws its own name with `.svg`.
`-o` names another file, and creates its folder when it does not exist.

## Top level

```json
{
  "archgram": 1,
  "title": "linkshort",
  "description": "A redirect reads the cache and queues the click; a worker counts clicks into Postgres.",
  "direction": "right",
  "card": "horizontal",
  "logo": "corner",
  "palette": "mono",
  "legend": true,
  "signal": "wire",
  "still": "none",
  "border": "spark",
  "wait": "solid",
  "glow": true,
  "credit": true,
  "nodes": [],
  "frames": [],
  "edges": [],
  "flows": [],
  "hints": {}
}
```

| Field | Required | Values | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `archgram` | yes | `1` | | The spec format's version |
| `title` | yes | text | | The diagram's name; the SVG's `<title>` |
| `description` | yes | text | | The whole diagram in prose; the SVG's `<desc>`, read by screen readers |
| `direction` | no | `right`, `down`, `auto` | `right` | The direction of the flow. `auto` lets archgram choose: left to right while it keeps its text readable where the diagram is shown (`shownWidth`), and otherwise whichever of left to right and top to bottom is narrower. It is chosen from the spec alone, so the same spec draws the same bytes, and `archgram build` says which it chose |
| `shownWidth` | no | a number of CSS pixels, 200 to 4,000 | a README on GitHub, 880 | How wide the diagram is shown where it is read. The widest drawing that keeps its text readable there is `shownWidth × 1300 / 880`: 1,300 px in a README, 996 px for 674. `direction: auto` chooses against it, and `archgram build` warns, still drawing, when a drawing is wider; width never fails `check` (docs/features/shown-width.md) |
| `card` | no | `horizontal`, `vertical` | `horizontal` | The card style for every node |
| `logo` | no | `corner`, `inline`, `chip`, `icon` | `corner` | Where technology logos go: the card's corner, before the note (or the technology's name), a chip on the icon, or in place of the icon |
| `palette` | no | a palette name | `mono` | The palette; light and dark are chosen when rendering |
| `legend` | no | `true`, `false` | `true` | Whether to draw the legend, when the diagram has one (DESIGN.md, Components: Legend) |
| `signal` | no | `wire`, `spark`, `arc`, `comet`, `dot`, `pulse`, `current` | `wire` | How a flow's signal is drawn along the lines (DESIGN.md, Components: Signal) |
| `still` | no | `none`, `legend`, `numbers` | `none` | What the still image shows of the flows, where nothing moves: nothing more, each flow in words under the legend, or each step's number on its lines |
| `border` | no | `spark`, `drain`, `ring`, `afterglow` | `spark` | How a lit card's border is drawn from the arrow that reaches it: both ways round with a dot on each growing end, then draining toward the arrow that leaves, once round clockwise, or fading while the card is lit (DESIGN.md, Components: Signal) |
| `wait` | no | `solid`, `pending` | `solid` | How a refused card waits for a later flow to pass it: its refusal border as drawn, or marching round it as dashes (DESIGN.md, Components: Refusal) |
| `glow` | no | `true`, `false` | `true` | Whether a signal glows, faintly, in the styles that have a glow (`wire`, `spark`, `arc`); nothing else glows |
| `credit` | no | `true`, `false` | `true` | Whether to write a small "by archgram" in the drawing's bottom-right corner, hidden from screen readers |
| `nodes` | yes | list | | At least one node |
| `frames`, `edges`, `flows` | no | list | empty | |
| `hints` | no | object | empty | Layout hints, below |

The lists are empty above only to show the shape; complete specs are under
Examples.

## Nodes

```json
{ "id": "api", "kind": "service", "label": "API", "note": "3 replicas",
  "tech": "fastapi", "variant": "multi", "frame": "vpc" }
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Lowercase letters, digits and hyphens; unique among nodes and frames |
| `kind` | yes | One of the kinds below; decides the icon and the category |
| `label` | yes | The card's title |
| `note` | no | The card's subtitle: one short line |
| `tech` | no | A technology, by its Simple Icons slug (`postgresql`, `redis`, `react`); shows its logo. Lowercase letters, digits and `_` |
| `variant` | no | `single` (default), `multi` (several instances), `external` (not ours) |
| `frame` | no | The id of the frame the node sits in |
| `source` | no | The code behind the node: a path, or a list of paths for a node that stands for several parts (Sources, below) |

Kinds, by category:

| Category | Kinds |
|---|---|
| Core | `service`, `database`, `queue`, `cache`, `storage`, `users` |
| AI and LLM | `model`, `vector-store`, `tool`, `agent` |
| Build and tooling | `file`, `script`, `generated`, `check` |
| Clients | `browser`, `mobile`, `desktop` |

## Frames

```json
{ "id": "vpc", "label": "VPC" }
{ "id": "private", "label": "Private subnet", "parent": "vpc" }
```

A frame is a boundary around nodes: a network, a trust zone, a team's
service. `parent` nests one frame in another. A frame with no nodes and no
child frames is an error.

## Edges

```json
{ "from": "api", "to": "redis" }
{ "from": "api", "to": "postgres", "label": "on a miss", "style": "dashed" }
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `from`, `to` | yes | Node ids; the edge points from `from` to `to` |
| `label` | no | A few words on the line |
| `style` | no | `solid` (default) or `dashed`, for a path taken only sometimes |
| `source` | no | The code that makes the edge, usually a path with the words of its line after `#` (Sources, below) |

An edge means data or a call moving in the direction of the arrow. Two
edges between the same pair in the same direction are an error; use one
with a label.

## Flows

```json
[
  { "name": "a visit", "steps": ["browser", "api", "redis", "worker", "postgres"] },
  { "name": "a question", "steps": ["chat", "llm", ["find", "count"], "index"] },
  { "name": "a commit with a raw colour", "steps": ["person", "precommit", "core", "checks"], "stop": "checks" }
]
```

A flow is a path through the diagram that archgram animates, in order. A
step is a node id, or a list of ids reached at once: a branch. Every node
of a step must be reached by an edge from a node of the step before it,
and when a step has several nodes, each must have an edge to a node of
the step after it. A spec without flows gives a still diagram. When
several flows exist they play one after another, in the order listed.

A flow may stop: `stop` names the node that refuses it, which must be
the flow's last step and a single node. A ✕ marks the line into it, and
the refusal travels back along the flow to the node where it began
(DESIGN.md, Components: Refusal). The refusing node stays marked until a
later flow passes it, so a refused flow followed by one that passes the
same node shows a retry.

archgram times the flows itself (DESIGN.md, Layout: Motion): a signal's
speed is fixed, so a longer line takes longer; a branch's signals leave
together; signals that meet at a node arrive together. A card is lit
from the moment a signal reaches its arrowhead until every signal it
sends has arrived; the last card of a flow stays lit until its border
has closed. A refused flow's refusal travels back before the next flow
starts. A screen reader hears each flow in words, after the description,
a refused flow ending with the node that refused it.

## Hints

The layout needs no help, but it accepts some.

```json
{
  "hints": {
    "first": ["browser"],
    "last": ["postgres"],
    "sameLayer": [["worker", "redis"]],
    "order": [["api", "worker"]]
  }
}
```

| Hint | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `first`, `last` | These nodes go in the first or last layer |
| `sameLayer` | Each list shares one layer (one column when the flow runs right) |
| `order` | Within a layer, each list keeps this order, top to bottom or left to right |

A hint that contradicts the edges (a node placed before the node that
feeds it) is an error, reported with both nodes named.

## Sources

A node or an edge may name the code behind it, so archgram can say when
that code is gone. Sources are never drawn: a spec gives the same SVG
with or without them. Why, and what the check cannot find, is in
`docs/features/sources.md`.

```yaml
nodes:
  - { id: worker, kind: service, label: Worker, source: ../../src/worker.rs }
  - { id: billing, kind: service, label: Billing, source: [../../src/charge.ts, ../../src/refund.ts] }
edges:
  - { from: worker, to: links, source: "../../src/worker.rs#links.insert(" }
```

A source is a path to a file or a folder, from the folder the spec is in,
with its folders separated by `/` on every system and each name with the
capitals it has on disk; it is never absolute, never only `.` and `..`,
has `..` only at its start, and never names `.git` or a file that
commonly holds secrets rather than code (`.env`, `.env.*`, `.npmrc`,
`.pypirc`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`,
`*.pfx`, `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, or anything in
`.ssh`, `.aws`, `.gnupg` or `.docker`). After the first `#` (so a path
cannot hold one), it may carry a few words copied from one line of that
file: the line that makes the edge, or that defines the part, at least 3
characters other than spaces. The words are looked for as written, anywhere in the
file, so the source holds while the file changes around them; they are
found in a comment too, so pick words from the code itself. `source` is
one source or a list of them, never an empty list, and a spec names at
most 1000 sources.

`archgram check` reports, as problems, each path with nothing there,
each file that does not hold its source's words, and each folder given
words to look for; `archgram build` warns of the same and still draws.
Sources are looked up only under the project's folder: the nearest
folder above the spec that holds `.git`, else the folder archgram runs
in, and never a disk's root. A path that leads outside it is refused by
its text alone, before anything on the disk is looked at. A symbolic
link on the way is not followed. A file is read only to look for a
source's words, once however many sources name it, and only a regular
file of at most 4 MiB; nothing of it is printed or kept. A spec without
sources looks nothing up (SECURITY.md, What archgram reads).

A writer that reads the code, a person or an agent such as the
`archgram` skill, gives a source to every node a file backs (not to the
people or systems outside the code, such as a browser) and to every
edge: the file behind a node (the files, for a node that stands for
several parts), and for an edge the file with a few words copied exactly
from the line that makes it. From `docs/diagrams/`, the paths start with
`../../`.

In YAML, quote every source that holds a `#`: unquoted, ` #` starts a
comment, which drops the rest of the words, and `: ` starts a key.

## Validation

A spec is rejected, with every problem listed at once and each located by
its JSON pointer (or its line and column in YAML), when:

- a required field is missing, a field is unknown, or a value is not one
  of those allowed;
- `shownWidth` is not a number from 200 to 4,000;
- a text (the title, the description, a label, a note or a flow's name)
  holds a character XML does not allow, such as a control character
  other than tab, line feed and carriage return: the SVG would not open;
- an id is duplicated, or an edge, flow, frame or hint names an id that
  does not exist;
- frames nest in a cycle, or a frame is empty;
- the nodes of an `order` hint do not share a frame (a frame keeps its
  nodes together, so a hint cannot sort them among others);
- a hint contradicts the edges: a `sameLayer` group whose nodes an edge
  joins, or a path of edges leads from one to another (through other
  groups too), a `first` node an edge leads into, or a `last` node an
  edge leads out of;
- a flow step is not reached by an edge from the step before it, a node
  of a branching step has no edge to the step after it, a step lists no
  nodes, or a step lists a node twice;
- a flow's `stop` names no node, or a node that is not its last step, or
  its last step is a branch;
- `tech` names a logo archgram does not carry (the error suggests the
  nearest slugs);
- a `source` is empty, absolute, only `.` and `..`, has a `..` after a
  name, names `.git` or a file that commonly holds secrets (Sources),
  holds `\`, has fewer than 3 characters after its `#` or more than one
  line there, or is an empty list; or the spec names more than 1000
  sources.

`archgram check` then holds each source to the code (Sources).

## Theme file

A project with its own design tokens can draw in its own colours: a
mapping file, `archgram.theme.json` by convention, passed with
`--theme-file` (and checked with `archgram theme check`), names the
project's resolver and which token fills each of archgram's colour roles.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "resolver": "design-system/tokens/design.resolver.json",
  "roles": {
    "canvas": "color.surface.page",
    "card": "color.surface.raised",
    "text": "color.text.primary",
    "icon-ai": "{color.accent.violet}"
  },
  "themes": {
    "light": { "inputs": { "theme": "light" } },
    "dark": { "inputs": { "theme": "dark" }, "roles": { "card-edge": "color.border.strong" } }
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `version` | yes | The mapping format's version. Only `1` exists |
| `resolver` | yes | The project's resolver document (Design Tokens 2025.10), relative to this file, in its folder or below |
| `roles` | no | Each archgram role's token, by its dotted id, with or without braces |
| `themes.light`, `themes.dark` | yes | `inputs`: the resolver's input for each modifier, to pick that theme; `roles`: roles this theme maps differently |

The roles are `badge`, `canvas`, `card`, `card-edge`, `connector`,
`frame`, `icon-ai`, `icon-build`, `icon-client`, `icon-core`,
`signal-core`, `signal-pass`, `signal-refusal`, `text` and `text-muted`
(DESIGN.md, Colors). A role the file
leaves out keeps the mono palette's colour. The file replaces the spec's
`palette`.

archgram reads the resolver's sets, modifiers (an input, else the
modifier's default), its resolution order (later sources win), `$ref` to
files beside it and to its own sets, inline tokens, `{alias}` values and
`$ref` JSON Pointers inside values, and `$type` from the groups above a
token. A colour may be in `srgb`, `srgb-linear`, `hsl`, `hwb`, `oklab`,
`oklch` or `display-p3`; in another space it needs a `hex` to fall back
on. Channels outside sRGB are clipped. A role's colour is opaque.

An import is refused, with every problem listed and each located by file
and JSON pointer, when the mapping or the resolver breaks its format; a
role is not archgram's; an input names no modifier or no context; a
modifier without a default gets no input; a file cannot be read, is a
remote reference, or is outside the mapping file's folder (by its real
path, so neither `..` nor a symlink leads out); a token does not exist (the nearest are suggested), is
not a colour, or aliases in a loop; a group uses `$extends`; a colour
cannot be read; or a pair of roles falls below the contrast DESIGN.md
requires, in either theme.
