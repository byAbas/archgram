//! When each flow's signals move and which cards they light (DESIGN.md,
//! Motion). Pure arithmetic on whole milliseconds, so the same spec keeps
//! the same timing on every machine.
//!
//! A flow is a list of steps, each one node or several reached at once. A
//! signal leaves every node of a step for each node of the next step it has
//! an edge to. It waits `motion.hop-gap` at its node, then travels at
//! `motion.speed`, a hop lasting between `motion.hop-min` and
//! `motion.hop-max`. Signals meeting at one node arrive together, when the
//! slowest does. A card is lit from the moment a signal reaches it until
//! every signal it sent has arrived, its border drawn over `motion.hop-min`;
//! the last step's cards stay lit until their border has closed.
//!
//! A flow that stops is refused at its last step: `motion.fade` after the
//! signal arrives, the refusal travels back along every line the flow took,
//! `motion.refusal-hop` for each step, to the flow's first step. The
//! refusing card stays refused until a later flow lights it, the first
//! step's until the next flow starts. Flows play one after another, and
//! `motion.rest` passes before the next one and before the cycle repeats.
