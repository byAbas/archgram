//! Orthogonal edge routing for the layered layout (ARCHITECTURE.md, Route).
//!
//! Every edge, split into hops between adjacent layers, runs through the
//! gaps between layers, where no card stands:
//!
//! - a hop whose two ends are level is one straight segment;
//! - otherwise it leaves its start, turns in the gap onto a vertical
//!   segment (a *track*), and turns again into its end: a symmetric Z.
//!
//! Vertical segments in one gap that overlap get separate tracks. Their
//! order is chosen pair by pair to cross fewer of the other hops' horizontal
//! segments, then each segment takes the lowest track free of the segments
//! it overlaps. A gap with many tracks is widened by the layout.
//!
//! Coordinates here are in the layout's frame: "main" runs along the flow,
//! "cross" across it.
