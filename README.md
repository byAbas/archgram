Aesthetic architecture diagrams, straight from the code. Animated flows,
light and dark.

archgram is an open-source CLI tool for software architecture diagrams.
Write a YAML or JSON spec, or let Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or Gemini CLI
draw one from your code. It writes one self-contained SVG that follows
light and dark mode and animates the path a request takes. The file drops
into a GitHub README or any docs page, and the animation plays wherever an
image shows.

![A visitor's request goes to the API, which reads the URL cache in Redis, falls back to Postgres on a miss and adds the click to a Redis stream; a worker drains the stream into Postgres. The animation follows the visit.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byAbas/archgram/main/docs/images/linkshort.svg)

You describe the system: its nodes, what connects them and the paths a
request takes. archgram lays it out, routes the lines around the boxes and
draws it, in light and dark, with the flows animated.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save-dev archgram
```

The command is a native binary for macOS, Linux and Windows, on x64 and
arm64. npm installs the one for your machine from an optional dependency,
`@archgram/cli-<os>-<cpu>`; nothing runs or downloads at install time.

If npm was told to leave optional dependencies out (`--omit=optional`),
or the lockfile was written on another platform, the binary is missing:
delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and run `npm install` again.
`ARCHGRAM_BINARY` points the command at another binary.

## Use

Write a spec in JSON or YAML, for example
`docs/diagrams/linkshort.archgram.yaml`:

```yaml
archgram: 1
title: linkshort
description: A visit goes through the API to Postgres.
nodes:
  - { id: browser, kind: browser, label: Visitor }
  - { id: api, kind: service, label: API, tech: fastapi }
  - { id: db, kind: database, label: links, tech: postgresql }
edges:
  - { from: browser, to: api }
  - { from: api, to: db }
flows:
  - { name: a visit, steps: [browser, api, db] }
```

Then draw it:

```sh
npx archgram build docs/diagrams/linkshort.archgram.yaml
```

It writes `docs/diagrams/linkshort.svg` beside the spec, light and dark in
one file.

## Commands

### `archgram build <spec>`

Draws the diagram. A spec named `<name>.archgram.yaml` (or `.yml`,
`.json`) draws `<name>.svg` beside it.

```sh
npx archgram build docs/diagrams/linkshort.archgram.yaml
```

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `-o <file.svg>` | Writes another file, and creates its folder when it does not exist |
| `--theme auto\|light\|dark` | Which theme the file carries: `auto`, the default, both, following the reader's dark mode; `light` or `dark` one only |
| `--split-themes` | Writes `<name>.light.svg` and `<name>.dark.svg`, for a page that picks one per reader |
| `--theme-file <archgram.theme.json>` | Draws in your design system's colours, from its design tokens (W3C Design Tokens) |
| `--system-font` | Leaves the text to the reader's font instead of embedding Geist |

### `archgram check <spec>`

Checks a spec without drawing it, and lists every problem at its line and
column, with the nearest id or logo when one is misspelt. When a node or
an edge names the code behind it (`source`), it also says which of that
code is gone: a part or a line whose code was removed is reported, and
`archgram build` warns of the same and still draws.

```sh
npx archgram check docs/diagrams/linkshort.archgram.yaml
```

### `archgram spec`

Prints the spec format this archgram reads: every field, node kind and
rule.

```sh
npx archgram spec
```

### `archgram theme check <archgram.theme.json>`

Reads your design tokens as the theme and shows each colour role in light
and dark, or every problem, such as a pair that falls short of contrast.

```sh
npx archgram theme check archgram.theme.json
```

### `archgram --version`, `archgram --help`

Print the version, or every command and option.

## Draw with your coding agent

The `archgram` skill lets a coding agent draw a project's architecture from
its code: it reads the code and the docs, writes the spec in
`docs/diagrams/`, checks and draws it with `npx archgram`, in the project's
own colours, and lists each part it drew with the file behind it. It is
written to the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format, so any
agent that reads skills can use it: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub
Copilot, Gemini CLI and others. Install it with the
[`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) command, which puts it
where each of your agents looks:

```sh
npx skills add byabas/archgram
```

It asks which agents to install it for; add `-g` to install it for every
project rather than this one. Then ask your agent to draw the architecture,
or, in Claude Code, type `/archgram`.

Or take it from the release, into your agent's skills folder
(`~/.agents/skills`, or `~/.claude/skills` for Claude Code):

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills && curl -sL https://github.com/byAbas/archgram/releases/download/v0.6.1/archgram-skill-0.6.1.tar.gz | tar -xz -C ~/.agents/skills
```

The skill's archive carries a signed record of the build that made it:
`gh attestation verify archgram-skill-X.Y.Z.tar.gz -R byAbas/archgram`.
0.5.0 and earlier were built before the account was renamed, and their
records carry its earlier name.

## FAQ

### Does the animation play in a README or a docs page?

Yes. The flows are animated with SMIL inside the SVG, which needs no
script, so the drawing moves in an `<img>`: in a GitHub README, on npm and
in any docs page.

### Does it follow dark mode?

One SVG carries both themes and follows the reader's system setting. To
follow GitHub's own theme instead, draw with `--split-themes` and put the
two files in a `<picture>` with `prefers-color-scheme`.

### Does it need a server, a browser or the network?

No. archgram is one native binary, and the SVG is self-contained: no
script, no external file, no web font, so it shows the same wherever it is
opened.

### How is it different from Mermaid?

Mermaid draws many kinds of diagram from text and is rendered by the page
that shows it; GitHub renders it in Markdown. archgram draws one kind, the
architecture of a system, into an SVG file ahead of time: it routes the
lines around the cards, animates the flows and embeds its font, so the file
looks the same everywhere. For a sequence diagram or a chart, Mermaid is
the better tool.

### How is it different from draw.io or Excalidraw?

draw.io and Excalidraw are canvases you arrange by hand, which suits a
sketch. archgram places everything from the spec, so the diagram lives in
git beside the code and changes in a diff when the system does.

### How is it different from D2 or PlantUML?

D2 is a language for many kinds of diagram, and PlantUML draws UML from
text, such as sequence, class and deployment diagrams. archgram draws one
kind, the architecture of a system, from a spec in plain YAML or JSON that
an agent can write from the code; it routes the lines, animates the flows
inside the SVG and gives the same file on every machine. For UML, PlantUML
is the better tool; for a diagram in many shapes, D2 is.

### How is it different from Structurizr and the C4 model?

Structurizr models a system once in its DSL and draws several C4 views
from that model; it is the C4 model's reference implementation. archgram
draws one diagram per spec, the parts and the path a request takes, as an
animated SVG for a README or a docs page. To keep several C4 views in
step, Structurizr is the better tool.

### Can a coding agent draw my architecture from the code?

Yes, with the `archgram` skill (above): it reads the code, draws a part
only where a file backs it and an edge only where a line of code makes it,
and lists both.

### How do I keep architecture diagrams in sync with the code?

Keep the spec in git beside the code. archgram redraws the diagram from
it, and its agent skill can write the spec again from the code, so the
diagram changes in the same pull request as the system.

### Can it use my design system's colours?

Yes: `--theme-file` maps archgram's colour roles to your design tokens
(W3C Design Tokens), and refuses colours that fall short of contrast
([docs/SPEC.md, Theme
file](https://github.com/byAbas/archgram/blob/main/docs/SPEC.md)).

### Will the same spec give the same file tomorrow?

Yes, byte for byte, on every machine, so a diagram changes in git only
when the system does.
