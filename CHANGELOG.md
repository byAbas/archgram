# Changelog

Each release's changes, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The `archgram` skill draws from a document the user names, such as a
  docs page, a design doc or an article, in place of the code: a part
  only where a sentence states it, an edge only where a sentence says one
  part reaches another, each with that sentence's words as its source,
  so `archgram check` holds the drawing to the text. Labels use the
  document's own words; what it does not state is reported as a gap. A
  tenth evaluation case draws Azure's Backends for Frontends example.
- Sequence diagrams, after UML's (docs/SPEC.md, Sequence). A spec names
  its kind, `diagram: sequence`; a spec that does not is an architecture
  diagram, as before, and draws the same bytes. A sequence holds
  participants, calls, sends that do not wait, replies, `alt`, `opt`,
  `loop` and `par` fragments with their guards, and refused messages, each
  with its sources, which `archgram check` holds to the code.
  `archgram build` draws it top to bottom, still, each message numbered,
  in one of two looks (`look`): `cards`, card heads and a bar while a
  participant answers a call, or `avatars`, round heads and no bars. In
  both, each participant's lifeline is a band, each label in a pill, a
  call's arrowhead filled, a send's and a reply's open, a reply's line
  dashed, each fragment framed with its operator and guard in a pill, a
  refusal's ✕. `examples/` holds two.

### Changed

- An edge label wider than `label.max-width` (120 px) wraps onto two
  lines, split at the space that keeps the longer line shortest, so a
  long label no longer pushes two columns apart. Flowing down, a wrapped
  label reaches half as far across, so its card grows less. A label with
  no space stays on one line.
- The `archgram` skill keeps an edge's label to a few words, two or
  three, naming the call or the data, and puts any detail in a node's
  `note` or its report: a long label pushes the cards apart.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- `shownWidth` says how wide a diagram is shown, in CSS pixels, when it
  is not a README on GitHub. `direction: auto` keeps left to right while
  the drawing keeps its text readable there (`shownWidth × 1300 / 880`,
  996 px for a 674 px column), and `build` warns, still drawing, when it
  is wider, with the other direction's width when that one fits. A spec
  without it draws the same bytes as before.

### Changed

- The `archgram` skill writes `shownWidth` when a diagram is shown
  anywhere but a README on GitHub, and once a drawing is accepted writes
  the direction archgram chose in place of `direction: auto`, so a later
  edit never turns it on its side. An update keeps the spec's direction;
  a drawing too wide for where it is shown follows `build`'s advice.
- Edges entering one side of a card each arrive at a point of their own,
  `spacing.edge-edge` apart, instead of merging into one: lines from
  different cards merged into one point read as one trunk, and a reader
  could not tell which card each came from. The one level with the card
  stays in the middle and straight. With `still: numbers`, each such line
  shows its own number.
- Every node kind's icon now comes from the free Stroke Rounded set of
  Hugeicons, drawn in archgram's own stroke, with round caps and joins.
  A diagram grows by about 4 to 19 %, by its number of cards.
- The `archgram` skill draws in archgram's own colours unless the user
  asks for others, such as the project's own: it no longer reads the
  styling code nor writes a theme unasked. Asked, it finds the project's
  colours as before, and a theme already at the project's root keeps
  being used.

### Fixed

- `--help` (or `-h`) after a command, such as `archgram build --help`,
  prints the help instead of reading `--help` as a spec's name.
- In a YAML spec, an unquoted comma inside `{ }` (`note: TLS, auth`) is
  named as the cause of the unknown field it makes, with the way out:
  quote a value that holds a comma.
- A `tech` archgram has no logo for is refused with each suggested slug
  beside its brand's name, such as `storyblok` (Storyblok) for
  `storybook`, since a slug one letter away can be another product, and
  says to leave `tech` out when none is the technology.
- Edge labels no longer overlap or lie across a frame's border. A card
  too short for the labels of the edges leaving one side, as happens
  flowing down, grows instead of pressing them together, and a label on
  an edge leaving a frame sits past the frame's border.
- The `archgram` skill's description holds no angle brackets: a
  description cannot contain XML tags, and `<name>` read as one. It
  triggers as before.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- `direction: auto` lets archgram choose the direction: left to right
  while it is no wider than 1,300 px, the most a README on GitHub shows
  at a readable size, and otherwise the narrower of left to right and
  top to bottom. The same spec still
  draws the same bytes, and a spec without `direction` keeps left to
  right.
- `archgram build` says the size it drew and the direction
  (`wrote architecture.svg (541 × 678 px, top to bottom)`), and warns
  when the drawing is wider than 1,300 px, with what would bring it
  within.
- `archgram spec --brief` prints the format's short part, about a tenth
  of it: one complete spec that uses each field most diagrams need, and
  a line for each other section. `archgram spec --section <name>` prints
  one section, by its heading or its short name (`theme-file`).

### Changed

- The `archgram` skill reads the short part of the format (`archgram
  spec --brief`), and a section only when it needs one, such as the
  theme file. It pre-approves those two commands, which only print.
- The skill leaves the direction to archgram (`direction: auto`) and
  reads the drawing's size from `archgram build`, rather than editing
  the spec and drawing again when the drawing came out too wide. It
  checks the spec again after every change, the last one included,
  before it draws.
- The skill draws only what the code shows: a note taken from the README
  alone goes to the report as a gap. It names a merged node's parts in
  its note, gives an edge from outside the code the line that receives
  it, changes only what an update found, and names the style it
  recognised; when two styles fit, the one with the more specific sign,
  so a registry that hands its extensions an API makes a plugin host.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- The `archgram` skill's folder is also a Claude Code plugin of that one
  skill, with a manifest, an icon and a README, listed in Anthropic's
  directory for Claude Code. Installing it takes the skill's folder
  alone, not the repository. The README says what the skill runs, its
  privacy (it collects nothing) and its terms (MIT).
- A node or an edge may name the code behind it, `source`: a path from
  the spec's folder, with a few words of the line that makes it after
  `#`. `archgram check` fails, and `archgram build` warns, when that code
  is not there: a part or a line whose code was removed is reported.
  Sources are looked up only under the project's folder (the nearest
  above the spec that holds `.git`), and are never drawn.
- The `archgram` skill writes a source for every node a file backs and
  every edge it draws, and starts an update from what `archgram check`
  says has lost its code.

### Changed

- A spec or theme file reached through a symbolic link under the folder
  archgram runs in is refused, where before it was followed: give
  archgram the file the link leads to.
- The `archgram` skill runs the archgram released with it, named exactly
  (`archgram@0.7.0`), when the project has no archgram of its own, rather
  than the latest on npm. A version published later runs only once a new
  skill names it. A project that lists archgram in its `package.json`
  still draws with its own.
- The skill pre-approves one command, `archgram spec` at its version,
  which only prints the spec format, rather than any command that starts
  with `npx --yes archgram`. `check`, `build`, `theme check` and the
  project's own archgram ask first.
- The skill runs npx with `--loglevel=error`, so npm's own warnings,
  such as `Unknown project config` in a project whose `.npmrc` holds
  pnpm's settings, no longer reach the agent. archgram's output and exit
  code are the same.

### Security

- archgram reads a spec, a theme file and the files a theme names only if
  each is a regular file of at most 4 MiB, reached through no symbolic
  link that may have come with it; a FIFO or a device is never opened.
  Before, a spec in a pull request that CI checks could make archgram
  read a file outside the project, or wait or use memory without end.
- A problem with a spec no longer quotes a text from it: a file read as
  a spec by mistake is not printed back.
- A theme's path that leads out of its folder is refused by its text,
  whether a file is there or not, so a theme cannot learn which files
  exist outside its project; nor does a theme read `.git` or a file that
  commonly holds secrets.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-01

0.6.0 was tagged but never reached npm: its packages were staged and
rejected, and npm does not stage a rejected version again. 0.6.1 is the
same release.

### Added

- A step's number lights as a signal passes it: its pill's edge is drawn
  in green from where the line enters, both ways round, and then fades
  as an arrowhead does. The still image keeps the plain number.
- The `archgram` skill works with any coding agent that reads the Agent
  Skills format, not Claude Code alone: Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot,
  Gemini CLI and others. Install it with `npx skills add byabas/archgram`.

### Changed

- With `still: numbers`, the numbers sit above the signals, so a line
  passes under them and the digits stay readable.
- The skill leaves `still` out unless asked, or unless the drawing is
  meant to be seen still; then it numbers one or two flows and lists
  more under the legend.

### Fixed

- Two cards that each lead to the same two cards no longer run along one
  line: their lines no longer cross in an X of bends or share a stretch.
- The halo of a `spark` or `arc` signal glows round on every side, not
  in a hard-edged quarter beside the dot.
- With `still: numbers`, lines that meet before a card show their
  numbers in one badge (`1,5`) instead of one above the other, and a
  number keeps clear of a frame's name and of a refusal's ✕.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- A flow may stop at its last step (`stop`): a ✕ marks the line into the
  refusing node, the refusal travels back along the flow to where it
  began, and the refusing card stays red until a later flow passes it,
  so a retry reads as one.
- A lit card's border is drawn from the arrow that reaches it, both ways
  round, in green, on the card's own edge; `border` picks how: `spark`
  (a dot riding each end, the default), `drain`, `ring` or `afterglow`.
  `wait: pending` shows a refused card waiting as marching dashes.
- Two colour roles, `signal-pass` and `signal-refusal`, held to 3:1
  against the card.
- An arrowhead takes the colour of the signal that reaches it.

### Changed

- A lit card takes no fill and keeps its border's width; its icon and
  text keep their colours.
- Only a signal glows, and more softly in dark; `glow: false` turns it
  off. Nothing else glows.
- The last card of a flow stays lit until its border has closed.
- The `archgram` skill walks from a project's entry points at one level
  of detail, names each part after the file that decides, backs every
  edge with the line of code that makes it, draws no wider than 1,300 px,
  and never starts a browser. It recognises the system's style of
  architecture, merges parts with the same relations into one node, and
  keeps a drawing to about ten nodes and twelve edges, and checks each
  line it cites by opening it.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- A spec named `<name>.archgram.yaml` (or `.yml`, `.json`) draws
  `<name>.svg` beside it, so a project keeps each spec next to its
  drawing under a plain name.
- `-o` into a folder that does not exist creates the folder.
- An edge's label lights with its signal: while the signal is seen, the
  label's text takes the signal's colour, and the signal and its glow fade
  out round it, so nothing crosses or boxes the text. A colour too faint
  for text on the canvas shows as the text colour instead.
- A small, quiet "by [mark] archgram" in the drawing's bottom-right
  corner, with archgram's mark between the words; `credit: false` turns
  it off.
- `archgram spec` prints the spec format this archgram reads, so whoever
  writes a spec reads the format of the very command that draws it.
- The `archgram` skill for Claude Code, in `skills/archgram`: it draws a
  project's architecture from its code and docs, in the project's own
  colours, and lists each part with the file behind it.

### Changed

- A diagram is monochrome: icons, signals and lit cards are in the text
  colour, black on light and white on dark; the technology logos keep
  their brands' colours. The legend lists only the variants, since colour
  no longer tells a category apart.
- A technology logo is always in its brand's own colour, not only while a
  flow's signal lights its card. A brand colour that would not show on the
  card in a theme is the text colour there.
- A technology logo in a card's corner is larger, 18px instead of 14, so
  it reads at a glance.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Flows animate along the lines. A step may branch: several nodes reached
  at once. The timing follows each line's length; branches leave together
  and paths that meet arrive together.
- Seven signal styles (`signal`): the line filling (the default), spark,
  arc, comet, dot, pulse and current.
- A card is lit while a signal is at it: its border and a tint in its
  hue, and its technology logo in its brand's colour.
- What the still image shows of the flows (`still`): nothing more, the
  flows in words under the legend, or each step's number on its lines.
  Under `prefers-reduced-motion` nothing moves. A screen reader hears each
  flow in words.
- A project's own design tokens (W3C Design Tokens 2025.10) as the theme,
  through a mapping file: `--theme-file` and `archgram theme check`. The
  colours must keep the same contrast as archgram's own.
- The command on npm for Node: `npm install archgram` installs the native
  binary for macOS, Linux or Windows, on x64 or arm64.

### Changed

- The embedded fonts carry only the tables a renderer needs: about 49 KB
  each instead of 126 KB, with every character unchanged.
- A crash says it is a bug in archgram and where to report it.

### Fixed

- `check` refuses a layout hint the edges contradict, as `build` does. A
  `sameLayer` group whose nodes a path of edges joins is refused, where
  the layout used to crash.
- A text holding a character XML does not allow is refused: the SVG would
  not open.

### Security

- The drawing is written to a new file and renamed into place, so a
  symlink at the output is replaced, never written through.
- A theme reads only regular files under its mapping file's folder, by
  their real paths.
- A problem prints a spec's control characters as escapes, so a spec
  cannot drive the terminal or a CI log.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Frames, nested, around groups of nodes.
- Variants: several instances, and external systems.
- A legend of the categories and variants a diagram uses.
- Technology logos from Simple Icons, in four places: the card's corner,
  before its note, a chip on its badge, or in place of its icon.
- YAML specs, with every problem at its line and column.
- `--split-themes`: one file per theme from one layout.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- The JSON spec, validated with every problem at its JSON pointer.
- Every node kind with its own icon; horizontal and vertical cards.
- A layered layout and orthogonal edge routing, with rounded bends and
  open arrowheads.
- One SVG with light and dark, text measured and drawn in an embedded
  subset of Geist.
- `archgram build` and `archgram check`.
