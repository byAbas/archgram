# Changelog

Each release's changes, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The `archgram` skill's folder is also a Claude Code plugin of that one
  skill, with a manifest, an icon and a README, so Anthropic's plugin
  directory can list it. Installing it takes the skill's folder alone,
  not the repository. The README says what the skill runs, its privacy
  (it collects nothing) and its terms (MIT).
- A node or an edge may name the code behind it, `source`: a path from
  the spec's folder, with a few words of the line that makes it after
  `#`. `archgram check` fails, and `archgram build` warns, when that code
  is not there, so a diagram cannot drift from the code unnoticed.
  Sources are never drawn.
- The `archgram` skill writes a source for every part and edge it draws,
  and starts an update from what `archgram check` says has lost its code.

### Changed

- The `archgram` skill runs the archgram released with it, named exactly
  (`archgram@0.6.1`), when the project has no archgram of its own, rather
  than the latest on npm. A version published later runs only once a new
  skill names it. A project that lists archgram in its `package.json`
  still draws with its own.
- The skill pre-approves one command, `archgram spec` at its version,
  which only prints the spec format, rather than any command that starts
  with `npx --yes archgram`. `check`, `build`, `theme check` and the
  project's own archgram ask first.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-01

0.6.0 was tagged but never reached npm: its packages were staged and
rejected, and npm does not stage a rejected version again. 0.6.1 is the
same release.

### Added

- A step's number lights as a signal passes it: its pill's edge is drawn
  in green from where the line enters, both ways round, and then fades
  as an arrowhead does. The still image keeps the plain number.
- The `archgram` skill works with any coding agent that reads the Agent
  Skills format, not Claude Code alone: Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot,
  Gemini CLI and others. Install it with `npx skills add byabas/archgram`.

### Changed

- With `still: numbers`, the numbers sit above the signals, so a line
  passes under them and the digits stay readable.
- The skill leaves `still` out unless asked, or unless the drawing is
  meant to be seen still; then it numbers one or two flows and lists
  more under the legend.

### Fixed

- Two cards that each lead to the same two cards no longer run along one
  line: their lines no longer cross in an X of bends or share a stretch.
- The halo of a `spark` or `arc` signal glows round on every side, not
  in a hard-edged quarter beside the dot.
- With `still: numbers`, lines that meet before a card show their
  numbers in one badge (`1,5`) instead of one above the other, and a
  number keeps clear of a frame's name and of a refusal's ✕.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- A flow may stop at its last step (`stop`): a ✕ marks the line into the
  refusing node, the refusal travels back along the flow to where it
  began, and the refusing card stays red until a later flow passes it,
  so a retry reads as one.
- A lit card's border is drawn from the arrow that reaches it, both ways
  round, in green, on the card's own edge; `border` picks how: `spark`
  (a dot riding each end, the default), `drain`, `ring` or `afterglow`.
  `wait: pending` shows a refused card waiting as marching dashes.
- Two colour roles, `signal-pass` and `signal-refusal`, held to 3:1
  against the card.
- An arrowhead takes the colour of the signal that reaches it.

### Changed

- A lit card takes no fill and keeps its border's width; its icon and
  text keep their colours.
- Only a signal glows, and more softly in dark; `glow: false` turns it
  off. Nothing else glows.
- The last card of a flow stays lit until its border has closed.
- The `archgram` skill walks from a project's entry points at one level
  of detail, names each part after the file that decides, backs every
  edge with the line of code that makes it, draws no wider than 1,300 px,
  and never starts a browser. It recognises the system's style of
  architecture, merges parts with the same relations into one node, and
  keeps a drawing to about ten nodes and twelve edges, and checks each
  line it cites by opening it.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- A spec named `<name>.archgram.yaml` (or `.yml`, `.json`) draws
  `<name>.svg` beside it, so a project keeps each spec next to its
  drawing under a plain name.
- `-o` into a folder that does not exist creates the folder.
- An edge's label lights with its signal: while the signal is seen, the
  label's text takes the signal's colour, and the signal and its glow fade
  out round it, so nothing crosses or boxes the text. A colour too faint
  for text on the canvas shows as the text colour instead.
- A small, quiet "by [mark] archgram" in the drawing's bottom-right
  corner, with archgram's mark between the words; `credit: false` turns
  it off.
- `archgram spec` prints the spec format this archgram reads, so whoever
  writes a spec reads the format of the very command that draws it.
- The `archgram` skill for Claude Code, in `skills/archgram`: it draws a
  project's architecture from its code and docs, in the project's own
  colours, and lists each part with the file behind it.

### Changed

- A diagram is monochrome: icons, signals and lit cards are in the text
  colour, black on light and white on dark; the technology logos keep
  their brands' colours. The legend lists only the variants, since colour
  no longer tells a category apart.
- A technology logo is always in its brand's own colour, not only while a
  flow's signal lights its card. A brand colour that would not show on the
  card in a theme is the text colour there.
- A technology logo in a card's corner is larger, 18px instead of 14, so
  it reads at a glance.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Flows animate along the lines. A step may branch: several nodes reached
  at once. The timing follows each line's length; branches leave together
  and paths that meet arrive together.
- Seven signal styles (`signal`): the line filling (the default), spark,
  arc, comet, dot, pulse and current.
- A card is lit while a signal is at it: its border and a tint in its
  hue, and its technology logo in its brand's colour.
- What the still image shows of the flows (`still`): nothing more, the
  flows in words under the legend, or each step's number on its lines.
  Under `prefers-reduced-motion` nothing moves. A screen reader hears each
  flow in words.
- A project's own design tokens (W3C Design Tokens 2025.10) as the theme,
  through a mapping file: `--theme-file` and `archgram theme check`. The
  colours must keep the same contrast as archgram's own.
- The command on npm for Node: `npm install archgram` installs the native
  binary for macOS, Linux or Windows, on x64 or arm64.

### Changed

- The embedded fonts carry only the tables a renderer needs: about 49 KB
  each instead of 126 KB, with every character unchanged.
- A crash says it is a bug in archgram and where to report it.

### Fixed

- `check` refuses a layout hint the edges contradict, as `build` does. A
  `sameLayer` group whose nodes a path of edges joins is refused, where
  the layout used to crash.
- A text holding a character XML does not allow is refused: the SVG would
  not open.

### Security

- The drawing is written to a new file and renamed into place, so a
  symlink at the output is replaced, never written through.
- A theme reads only regular files under its mapping file's folder, by
  their real paths.
- A problem prints a spec's control characters as escapes, so a spec
  cannot drive the terminal or a CI log.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Frames, nested, around groups of nodes.
- Variants: several instances, and external systems.
- A legend of the categories and variants a diagram uses.
- Technology logos from Simple Icons, in four places: the card's corner,
  before its note, a chip on its badge, or in place of its icon.
- YAML specs, with every problem at its line and column.
- `--split-themes`: one file per theme from one layout.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- The JSON spec, validated with every problem at its JSON pointer.
- Every node kind with its own icon; horizontal and vertical cards.
- A layered layout and orthogonal edge routing, with rounded bends and
  open arrowheads.
- One SVG with light and dark, text measured and drawn in an embedded
  subset of Geist.
- `archgram build` and `archgram check`.
